# NBA-Stats-Inflation-Analysis

Welcome! This is the repository for my research on NBA stats inflation. This paper investigates the phenomenon of scoring inflation in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and aims to identify potential change-points in various basketball statistics over a span of 47 seasons, from 1977 to 2024. Drawing from comprehensive datasets sourced from Basketball Reference, encompassing player per game stats, team per game stats, and team advanced stats, this research employs Bayesian change-point modeling to detect shifts in key performance metrics. Simulation results reveal intriguing insights: while no clear trend emerges in the leading scorers each season, average team scores and pace per game exhibits potential change-points around the early 1990s and the late 2000s. Notable rule changes around these periods, such as alterations to the shot clock and the three-point line, prompt further investigation into their impact on game dynamics and strategy. These findings underscore the complex interplay between rule changes and statistical trends in basketball, shedding light on the evolution of the sport over time.
